                Hi, nice to meet you! I want to thank you for taking the time to read through my application and personal statement. My name is Aashna Narang and I’m a third-year Software Engineering student at Carleton University. I want to use this opportunity to describe my personal journey in how I got here, my accomplishments, and what I am most passionate about.  
            </p>
            <h1>How It All Started</h1>
            <p>
                I was first introduced to programming in the 10th grade when I took my first programming class. Our class was “taught” Turing; I use quotation marks because my teacher didn’t really teach. Instead, she gave us a book to read and learn from. Even though I did not agree with the teaching style, this class still became one of my all-time favourite classes in high-school. I was always interested in making my own game and apps, so I taught myself the language and immediately fell in love with programming. I remember making my first text-based game with graphics and a fitness app. These projects weren’t crazy complex or anything, but they got me hooked on coding and they are the reason I decided to pursue Software Engineering.

            <h1>IEEE Women In Engineering</h1>
            <p>
                IEEE Women in Engineering (WIE) has been my passion project for the past two years. After noticing I was one of the 10 girls in my class of 150 students, I wanted to take this opportunity to celebrate diversity, promote inclusion, meet more women in my field, and make IEEE WIE more well-known in the community. 
                <br>
                <br>
                IEEE WIE had only hosted an annual Wine and Cheese networking event with IEEE WIE uOttawa for the past 9 years, but the IEEE WIE Chair at the time and I wanted to change that in 2018/2019. With very limited funds and only the two of us planning events, we went from hosting 1 joint event per year to hosting 5 successful events in the school year. The attendance to the Wine and Cheese increased from around 100 attendees to 150! We were able to form a strong connection with faculty, students, women in the industry, and the Women in Computer Science society. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I ran for the IEEE WIE Chair for the 2019/2020 school year and took the IEEE WIE affinity group to a whole new level. The new Vice-Chair and I hosted events with other engineering clubs, other women-oriented clubs, and with a ton more industry professionals, allowing IEEE WIE Carleton to become much more well known in the community. We hosted 7 events and increased student participation from ~10-20 to ~35-50 attendees per event! To add, I acted as the co-lead 2020 IEEE WIE Wine and Cheese and was able to get 13 companies to sponsor and fully fund the event! I was also nominated and won the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ieeecanadianfoundation.org/EN/sch_yr.php?fbclid=IwAR2dqqtjO5S6Ngm8EqYOLZuWVhNar7Tg6CQSXzCz8aJsNDDO-QQsniuityY">IEEE Canadian Foundation scholarship</a> for my continuous efforts and contributions to the Carleton branch.

            <p>
                Shopify heavily emphasizes the importance of diversity and inclusion in their company culture and it is something I strongly believe in as well. Participating in Technovation, a tech entrepreneurship competition founded by IBM and Shopify, was a defining moment for me in high-school. It gave me confidence and inspired me to continue in tech which was a gift I strive to give back to our community.

            <h1>CuHacking</h1>
            <p>
                In January 2020, I attended my first ever hackathon! I teamed up with two of my friends and decided that we wanted to focus on creating a strong UI/UX for our hack. While brainstorming for ideas, I remembered hearing a lot of my friends complain about how annoying it was to find a subletter or find a new apartment in our area, so I came up with the idea of creating a website that brought together all of the apartment listings in a specified area. We scraped data from Kijiji in real-time, displayed the important information, and included a rating that was calculated using ML to compare it to other similar listings in the area. We started out designing the layout of the listings by creating a prototype using Figma. Once that was done, I started helping out with the front-end. Before this, I had never used React.js, so I was learning as I go. Even though I was very new to every aspect of this project, we completed our hack and won the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://devpost.com/software/house-hunter-d12ij6"> Best UI/UX award</a>!

            <h1>Past Internships</h1>
            <p>
                Previously, I have worked as a Software Developer at Ross Video and Kx Labs. I was a part of a Scrum team at Ross Video and I helped develop customer-facing features, automate tests using the Robot framework, add unit tests, and fix bugs in an agile environment. Working here has helped me develop leadership and teamwork skills in a professional setting. Even as a co-op student, I led meetings and participated in making design decisions. My team loved that I always worked hard and was never afraid to take on tasks that were outside my comfort zone. My contributions and efforts helped my team complete our sprints on time and helped release our product on time! I contributed to each of the new features my team released to customers and became much more comfortable with Java, working with databases, HTML/JavaScript, and the Robot framework.

            </div>
            <p>
                At Kx Labs I focused on fully developing 2 projects on my own while learning JavaScript and q, a functional programming language. In four months, I learned q and JavaScript. I studied these languages in my free time to help speed up the learning process and help ship a plugin and feature for Kx Analyst. I first worked on a plugin that allows users to retrieve information on a hostname or IP address efficiently without any coding. Afterwards, I worked on a feature that was requested by several users and would help customers use the product more efficiently. Originally, users must open multiple sessions of Analyst to be able to simultaneously use multiple q processes. Now, users can connect editors to different q processes in one Analyst session with the feature I developed.This co-op term introduced me to web development and DNS name servers. At the end of my term, I developed the frontend, the backend, fully documented both projects, and wrote over 100 unit tests in total for both projects.

            <h1>Balance is Key</h1>
            <p>
                Is a motto I live by. When I’m not studying, I participate in clubs I am passionate about, learn new languages or skills, I paint, bake, workout, and stay social! I thoroughly enjoy teaching and helping people in every aspect of my life. For instance, I took time in the second year to teach business students how to code in Python.
                <br>
                <br>
                Although, I did notice that WIE took away time from working on my technical skills, so I decided to focus on more technical-oriented roles this year. I recently joined to help startup Blueprint Carleton, a new club that works with local nonprofits to provide them with technological solutions free of charge. I am the VP Projects for Blueprint, so I’m currently studying the non-profit sector to see what is the best way to help them and what the best business model would be. Later, I will be hiring and managing the dev team and working with them to support nonprofits. Other than that, I am learning C# through a Udemy class and creating a ‘Choose Your Own Adventure’ game in C# using Unity. I am starting an internship with Trend Micro for the summer and plan to take Udemy courses to learn Ruby and strengthen my backend skills!

            <h1>Peace!</h1>
            <p>
                Thank you for hearing me out! I appreciate it and I hope you will find a good fit for me for the Shopify developer internship position.
